- name: Paraphrase Detection using Deep Learning
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: Paraphrase-detection
  desc: Applied paraphrase detection to the medical domain of clinical prescriptions. Developed a Bidirectional RNN based model with multi perspective matching and Attention.

- name: Parallel k-means Clustering
  i18n: cpython
  gh_user: hehaichi
  repo: Parallel-K-means
  desc: Used k-means clustering for Image Colour Quantization and Image Compression. k-means clustering implemented in parallel on 3 platforms - OpenMP, CUDA and MPI with performance comparison.
- name: Android Malware Detection
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: Android-Malware-Detection
  desc: Classification of android apps done based on pseudo-dynamic analysis of system API Call sequences. Developed a Deep Autoencoder model for feature compression along with a CNN and RNN model.
- name: LIBO - Android App
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: libo-app
  desc: Smart Library management app which integrates Microsoft Azure database and Microsoft cognitive services (OCR) and also uses basic recommender systems with the help of the apriori algorithm.
- name: Deep Learning for conversational information agents
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: DeepNLP
  desc: Developed a Game of thrones themed chatbot using recurrent neural networks. Chatbot classifies user interaction as either conversational or a knowledge-seeking query. Conversations are handled using a generative sequence-to-sequence model. A retrieval sequence-autoencoder model used for answering knowledge-seeking queries.
- name: ID3 Decision tree predictor
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: ID3-Decison-tree
  desc:  Implemented the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 decision tree algorithm. The motivation was to see how this traditional algorithm performed on modern large datasets. Discretization of features which take continuous values using K-means clustering improved the performance.
- name: Project Management Portal
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: Project-Management-Portal
  desc:  Developed a project management portal for purchase departmant at NITK Surathkal for seamless management and querying of projects undertaken. Takes care of underlying bank work like financial statement, credit and debit heads and annual interest generation.
- name: Parallel Breadth First Search (BFS)
  i18n: google
  gh_user: aditya5558
  repo: Hadoop-codes
  desc:  Implemented parallel breadth first search (BFS) using Hadoop Map Reduce. Used this algorithm to solve the single-source all pairs shortest path problem.
